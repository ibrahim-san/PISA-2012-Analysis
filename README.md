## by Nasiru Mohammed Ibrahim


## Dataset

> PISA (Program for International Student Assessment) 2012 is the programmeâ€™s 5th survey. It assessed the competencies of 15-year-olds in reading, mathematics and science (with a focus on mathematics) in 65 countries and economies. Around 510 000 students between the ages of 15 years 3 months and 16 years 2 months participated in PISA 2012 as a whole representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally.

>The participating countries were split into two groups based on membership status in the OECD (The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development).

>The ISCED (The International Standard Classification of Education) level 0, is an early childhood programme that has an intentional education component. Student participation in the ISCED level 0 will also be considered.

## Summary of Findings

> A summary of the insights from the EDA:
<ul>
  <li>The scores from the math, science and reading tests are approximately normal in distribution.</li>
  <li>There is a high degree of correlation between the scores in the 3 tests. Students who perform well in one are likely to perform well in the other two.</li>
  <li>When grouped by gender, the male group tend to score higher in math, while the female group tend to score higher in reading. Performance in science is about equal for the two groups</li>
  <li>There is a higher proportion of students from OECD countries that attended the ISCED Level 0 programme compared to students from Non-OECD countries.</li>
  <li>There is no gender disparity in students from both OECD and Non-OECD countries</li>
  <li>Whether a student moved to another country at some point in the past or not hardly affected test performance. Further investigation might be required.</li>
  <li>Across all tests the top performing regions were mostly Asian, with the China-Shanghai region coming out on top in all test scores.</li>
  <li>Students from OECD countries tend to perform better in all tests than their Non-OECD counterparts.</li>
  <li>Attendance of the ISCED Level 0 is shown to have a positive impact on test performance.</li>
</ul>
